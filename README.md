# "Niche partitioning of the ubiquitous and ecologically relevant NS5 marine group"

This repository contains the data tables and the R script to recreate the main body figures from the manuscript. The packages that are required for the script to work are outlined within the script itself.

If you are interested in how any of the supplementary figures were made, I would be more than happy to send the R script. Simply create an issue on this repository and I will get back to you.
